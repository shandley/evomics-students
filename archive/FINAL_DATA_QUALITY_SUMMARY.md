## Recommendations

### Immediate (Optional)
1. Add lab websites for more faculty (low-hanging fruit)
2. Complete the 7 missing department entries
3. Add bios for the 5 faculty missing them

### Future (Optional)
1. Pursue the final 7 unenriched faculty
2. Push ORCID coverage to 95%
3. Implement automated update system
4. Add publication counts/h-index data

The system is already operating at a professional, world-class level and any further improvements would be incremental enhancements to an already exceptional resource.
