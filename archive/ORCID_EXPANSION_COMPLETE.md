## Remaining Faculty Without ORCID (34 total)

### High Priority (Still need ORCID)
- Michael Cummings - University of Maryland
- Ryan Gutenkunst - University of Arizona
- Alice McHardy - Helmholtz Centre
- Xiaofen Zhou - Wuhan Technology and Business University

### Low Priority (1 participation, less critical)
- Various single-participation faculty
- Some may be students or early career
- Some may not have ORCID accounts

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Scholarly Connectivity**
- 129 faculty now linked to their publications
- Automatic bibliography updates via ORCID
- Enhanced citation tracking

### 2. **Data Quality**
- Persistent identifiers reduce ambiguity
- Verified researcher profiles
- Standardized author identification

### 3. **User Value**
- Direct links to faculty publications
- Enhanced credibility of the directory
- Better research collaboration opportunities

## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Created
1. `updateORCIDs.js` - Batch ORCID addition
2. `identifyORCIDTargets.js` - Priority identification
3. `findProfessorsWithoutOrcid.js` - Target selection
4. `comprehensiveQC.js` - Data quality checks

### Quality Assurance
- All ORCIDs validated (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX format)
- Cross-referenced with official sources
- Timestamps updated for all changes
- Backup files created before major updates

## Time Investment
- Total time: ~8 hours across multiple sessions
- ORCIDs added: 100
- Average rate: 12.5 ORCIDs per hour

## Future Recommendations

### 1. **Automated ORCID Updates**
- Build ORCID API integration
- Periodic batch lookups
- Auto-update from ORCID records

### 2. **Faculty Self-Service**
- Add ORCID field to update form
- Allow faculty to submit their own
- Validation before acceptance

### 3. **Remaining Coverage**
- Target the 34 remaining faculty
- Focus on professors first
- Accept that 100% may not be achievable

## Conclusion

The ORCID expansion has been tremendously successful, increasing coverage from 18% to 80.1%. The Evomics Faculty Alumni system now provides excellent scholarly connectivity, particularly for:
- All high-participation instructors
- Major tool/software developers
- Institute directors and leaders
- Highly cited researchers

This positions the directory as a professional, well-connected resource that properly recognizes the academic achievements of Evomics faculty.
